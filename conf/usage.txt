Using Dipper:
Commands:

    Help := !help, !h
        Show usage data (this message!)

    Watch := !watch, !
        Arguments: <expression:ExpressionString> <threshold:PercentageFloat> <period:MinutesFloat> 
        Be notified if the expression changes by <threshold> since the last time it was triggered, a notification is sent out to the chat.
    
    List := !list, !ls, !w <subject>
        List all existing entries of the passed subject. Currently the only valid subject is "watches".


Queries:

    Coin Query := $<expression> <expression>


Expressions:

    An expression consists of coin identifiers, properties, and operators. Valid ways to refer to a coin includes:
        <coin>
        <coin>.<property>
    Further, these can be analyzed with common operators:
        +, -, /, *, ^, ()
    
    An expression may have no spaces, as expressions are separated by spaces. Invalid expressions will not receive a response (well most likely, they may receive an invalid response).
